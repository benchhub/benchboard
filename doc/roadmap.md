# Roadmap

- [ ] spec for running go benchmark
  - [ ] estimate duration and result based on previous results
  - [ ] report progress to UI during benchmark? (near real time graph like tensorboard)
- [ ] spec for running oltpbench ... after all have worked on that for a while ...
- [ ] run benchmark on different commit, might need to allow user to filter commits
- [ ] global `.benchhub` folder to keep track all the benchmark run by benchboard
